The measures currently being taken to combat the epidemic are unprecedented. In the coming weeks, many people will be risking their health, giving their energy 15 hours a day to save lives.

That is why, together with friends, we have launched (https://HelpCOVID-19.com) The objective is simple: to help people on the front line of the fight against the epidemic (carers, pharmacists, home care workers, people providing medicines, food, energy, ...).

Let's allow them not to worry about who will look after their children or whether there will be enough food at home when they come home.

Free, without advertising, open-source, not keeping your data, with the will to help voluntarily, our platform wants to allow the setting up of a fast, safe and easy mutual aid between individuals, in order to face the Covid-19 epidemic which strikes our country.

We are not a company, we only want to contribute at our level to the fight against the virus. And when we defeat it, our site will disappear.

If you're young and healthy, sign up to help someone close to you.

If you are a frontline worker and are having logistical difficulties, register to be put in touch with someone who can help you.

If you are a developer, contribute to this project to make it better and help as many people as possible.
